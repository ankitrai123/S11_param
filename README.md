**Introduction:**
Microstrip patch antennas are integral components of wireless communication systems, but optimizing their design, particularly concerning non-intuitive parameters, poses significant challenges. To tackle this issue, we propose a sophisticated cascaded AI architecture comprising a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Random Forest Regressor. This architecture aims to streamline the optimization process by predicting binary configurations and S11 parameters across various frequencies, thereby facilitating the design of efficient microstrip patch antennas.

**1. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):**
- **Objective:** Serving as the initial model, the CNN processes input data comprising 81 vector points representing microstrip patch antenna S11 parameters. It then outputs 16 binary pixel values capturing non-intuitive design characteristics.
- **Architecture:** 
  - The CNN begins with a 1D convolutional layer using a kernel size of 11 to extract features from the input data, followed by ReLU activation functions to introduce non-linearity.
  - Subsequent layers include dense layers with ReLU activation and dropout layers to prevent overfitting.
  - The final dense layer with softmax activation produces probabilities for each binary output, representing the likelihood of their presence in the antenna design.
- **Training Details:**
  - The CNN is trained for 2000 epochs with a batch size of 512. This extensive training process ensures that the model learns intricate patterns and relationships within the data effectively.
- **Integration with Second Model:** The CNN's output, alongside fixed frequency data spanning 10 to 20 GHz, serves as input for the Random Forest Regressor, aiding in accurate prediction of S11 parameters across frequencies.

**2. Random Forest Regressor:**
- **Objective:** As the second model, the Random Forest Regressor predicts S11 parameters based on CNN-generated binary configurations and fixed frequency data.
- **Architecture:** 
  - Utilizing ensemble learning, the regressor comprises multiple decision trees, each predicting S11 parameters for specific frequencies.
  - Configured with 100 estimators and a maximum depth of 5 levels, the regressor controls model complexity during training and prediction.
- **Training and Prediction:** 
  - Trained on datasets encompassing binary configurations, frequency data, and corresponding S11 parameters, the regressor learns intricate relationships between inputs and outputs.
  - Post-training, the regressor accurately predicts S11 parameters for new antenna configurations across frequencies, facilitating optimization of non-intuitive antenna designs.

**Importance for Non-Intuitive Antenna Design:**
- By leveraging the CNN's pattern extraction capabilities and the regressor's predictive prowess, the architecture addresses challenges in optimizing non-intuitive microstrip patch antenna designs.
- This integrated approach provides insights into complex design relationships, facilitating efficient exploration and refinement of antenna designs for enhanced performance in wireless communication systems.

This comprehensive architecture underscores its significance in optimizing microstrip patch antenna designs, particularly concerning non-intuitive parameters, fostering advancements in wireless communication technology.
